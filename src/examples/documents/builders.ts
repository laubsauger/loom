/**
 * The six example projects, as documents (§C "example projects", T153-T156).
 *
 * These are NOT the examples. The examples are the `.loom.json` files in `examples/`, and
 * §V88 is explicit that a hand-built in-memory graph cannot stand in for one: an example
 * that only exists as code proves the compiler works and proves nothing at all about the
 * file format. What lives here is the SOURCE the files are generated from, so the shipped
 * bytes are byte-identical to what `buildProjectFile` — the app's own save path — writes,
 * instead of hand-written JSON the app would silently rewrite differently on first save.
 *
 * `build-examples.ts` writes them; `sync.test.ts` fails if a shipped file and its source
 * here have drifted; `runner.test.ts` — the actual CI gate — never imports this module at
 * all. It reads the directory.
 *
 * Every parameter key below is taken from the node's manifest under
 * `src/nodes/definitions/`. A key that does not exist there is a compiler WARNING, not an
 * error, so the runner asserts zero diagnostics of any severity rather than zero errors:
 * a typo'd parameter renders silently wrong, which is exactly the class of mistake an
 * executable spec is for.
